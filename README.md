Thank you for taking the time to check out this exercise


Installation: 
1. Clone this repository to your local machine
2. Open the folder that you cloned this into and run:
    a) npm i
    b) npm run start

3. You now have the backend running. If it does not run, you may have something already running on port 3000. If that's the case you can either close that program, or change the port set in marvelous.js to another open port.
